---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All environment variables are managed via `.env` or your shell:

| Variable            | Description                        | Example                                         |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK`   | Your Discord webhook URL           | `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/.../...`      |

Other project constants are defined in [`src/config/index.ts`](src/config/index.ts), such as:

- `MEMBER_IDS`: array of member IDs to monitor.
- `STATE_FILE`: path to the JSON file used to persist last seen blogs.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Develop by yourself

Clone and install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/hinatazaka46-blog-monitor.git
cd hinatazaka46-blog-monitor
bun install
```

Run the monitor:
```bash
bun run src/index.ts
```

The script will:
- Validate environment variables
- Load the last seen state from `last_seen.json` (if it exists)
- For each member in MEMBER_IDS:
- - Fetch the latest blog
- - Compare with last seen
- - Post to Discord if new
- Save updated state back to disk
